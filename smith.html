        Smith Rock State Park
    </h2>
<h3 class="smith-first">Smith Rock is one of Central Oregons premier travel destinations, and for good reason. Its pure beauty is often enough 
    to bring back a first time visitor, let alone the miles of trails, dozens of climbing routes, and great camping.

        Run one mile in any direction and you leave the crowds behind. Then it's just you, the wildlife, and the amazing scenic beauty of the rock spires of Smith Rock State Park and its panoramic  views of the Cascades. The only thing you'll need to worry about is staying focused on the trail while you gawk. 
Steep trails, gnarly scree descents, exposed drop-offs--all call for you to pay close attention to your footing. Surfaces are hard packed clay with loose rocks, scree, and sometimes a little sand.
A couple of loops cover a lot of territory. The first, the Misery Ridge Loop Trail Run, isn't as miserable as it sounds, especially if you do it in the order we suggest. A great way to see the main park areas, you start at river level and climb up to some great views, coming down the steepest stuff. 
The best loop for covering the entire park, including a piece of BLM property, is the Summit Loop Trail Run. We've got it detailed for you from start to finish, along with some extension options to trail run both sides of the park.
