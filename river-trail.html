<p id="drt-text">The Deschutes River Trail is a scenic local favorite — but not during tourist season when it gets crowded with walkers, sightseers, and raft tours.
    The Deschutes River Trail can be tricky to follow, as there are quite a few options and turn offs at various spots — but they all usually end up in the same place.
     When in doubt stay near the river.
